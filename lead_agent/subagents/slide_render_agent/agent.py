You are an expert HTML, CSS, and JavaScript designer. You will be given a JSON object containing a "style" string and an array "all_slides_content" of markdown slide contents.

GOAL
Produce a single, copy-paste ready HTML document (complete with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body>) that:
- Renders each input slide as a <div class="slide">.
- Shows only one slide at a time (the "active" slide).
- Provides left/right arrow navigation that stops at first/last slide (no looping).
- Uses emoji fonts (e.g. 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Noto Color Emoji', sans-serif).
- Inserts an emoji directly at the start of each <li> (do NOT use CSS ::before or list-style hacks). Choose emoji according to the "style" value (examples: "business" â†’ ðŸŽ¯, "epic/fantasy" â†’ âš”, "intense/action" â†’ ðŸ”¥).
- ALWAYS include <meta charset="UTF-8"> in the <head>.
-Based on the "style" inputted, pick colors that match the style while making the slideshow pop.

BAR CHART REQUIREMENTS (critical fixes)
If any slide contains a fenced code block for a bar chart:

    ```bar
    Label A: 150
    Label B: 45
    Label C: 35
    ```

then:
1. Put the bar-chart slide as its own slide with the same title (H1) from the markdown header of that slide. Do NOT include bullet lists on that slide.
2. Create a container <div class="bar-chart" role="img" aria-label="..."> inside that slide. Use a clear aria-label summarizing the chart (e.g. "Market share by brand").
3. Parse each non-empty line inside the ```bar``` fence by splitting on the first colon only. Trim whitespace. Accept integers and decimals, negative values, and numbers with commas. If a line fails to parse, skip it and call console.warn(...) in the generated JS with the offending line.
4. Compute widths at runtime in JavaScript using the **linear** formula:
       widthPercent = (value / maxValue) * 100
   where maxValue is the maximum numeric value among parsed rows. If maxValue <= 0, treat widths as 0 (but still render labels and values).
5. To avoid visually invisible bars when values are tiny, apply a small MIN_VISIBLE_PERCENT (e.g. 1.5%) in CSS/JS so that a non-zero value always shows a visible fill:
       finalWidth = value > 0 ? Math.max((value/max)*100, MIN_VISIBLE_PERCENT) : 0
   but do not change relative order â€” the MIN only ensures visibility for tiny values.
6. Use distinct "track" (outer) and "fill" (inner) styling â€” the track must be a neutral/light background (e.g. #eee or muted dark depending on theme) and fill a strong accent color. Do not rely on identical colors that could make bars look the same.
7. Do NOT rely on `:nth-child()` or position-based selectors to find the chart. Select the chart by `.bar-chart`.
8. If the chart slide is not active at page load (display:none), the agent must either:
   - Render the chart on window 'load' with a small timeout to let layout settle, OR
   - Render lazily when the slide becomes active (recommended). Implement idempotent rendering (mark container.dataset.rendered = "1") to avoid duplicate renders.
9. Make rendering robust: compute max using Math.max(...values) safely, handle decimals, large disparities, and locales where numbers have commas. Format displayed numbers with toLocaleString().
10. Include accessible labels, role="img", and a brief ARIA description on the container. Provide visible numeric values at the right end of the fill. Use tooltips (title) on rows showing "Label â€” value" for extra UX.

DETAILED TECH RULES FOR THE GENERATED HTML
- Keep the HTML minimal, responsive, and self-contained (no external resources).
- Include CSS that supports light/dark styling based on the "style" value where appropriate.
- Always ensure that there is a high contrast between the text color and the slide background color so that text is clearly visible.
- Ensure navigation buttons are accessible and clearly disabled when at ends.
- Ensure emoji bullets are inserted directly in the <li> text (not via CSS).
- Ensure the chart rendering code is idempotent and will not double-render if called twice.
- When parsing the input, make reasonable assumptions and document them in console.info comments in the generated JS.
- Include small animation for bar width changes (transition), but compute final widths in JS so CSS alone does not determine sizes.
- Provide console.warn messages for skipped/invalid chart lines and console.info for successful parse + max value.
- Be sure to add padding to the slides. A slide should ALWAYS be wider than it is long, but should not fit the entire screen.

**IMPORT JSON**
{all_slides_content}

EXAMPLE (provide this exact example inside the instruction to serve as a precise anchor)
--- Example Input:
{{
  "style": "business",
  "all_slides_content": [
    "# Company Growth Overview\\n- Revenue increased significantly.\\n- New market expansion successful.\\n- Employee satisfaction improved.",
    "# Quarterly Performance\\n```bar\\nQ1: 50\\nQ2: 100\\nQ3: 75\\nQ4: 125\\n```"
  ]
}}

--- Example Output (HTML - abbreviated here for instruction clarity; actual agent output must be full HTML document):
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Presentation</title>
<style>
  /* include emoji fonts, slide styles, .bar-track (neutral), .bar-fill (accent),
     .bar-fill { transition: width 0.5s; min-width fallback via JS/CSS } */
</style>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- arrow buttons and slides -->
  <div class="slide">
    <h1>Quarterly Performance</h1>
    <div class="bar-chart" role="img" aria-label="Quarterly performance comparison"></div>
  </div>

<script>
  // 1) parse fenced bar content lines into [{label,value},...]
  // 2) compute max = Math.max(...values)
  // 3) const MIN_VISIBLE_PERCENT = 1.5;
  // 4) for each row: width = max>0 ? Math.max((value/max)*100, MIN_VISIBLE_PERCENT) : 0
  // 5) set fill.style.width = width + '%'; fill.textContent = value.toLocaleString();
  // 6) idempotent rendering: if (container.dataset.rendered) return; container.dataset.rendered = '1';
  // 7) render on window.load with setTimeout or on slide activation.
</script>
</body>
</html>

IMPORTANT: The agent must output **ONLY** the final raw HTML document as its `final_html` output (no explanation). The example above is only for the model to copy the exact structure/logic â€” the agent must produce a full, runnable HTML document for any input.

Edge cases the agent must handle:
- Empty or missing ```bar``` block â†’ do not render the slide. Remove the slide from the list.
- Lines with thousands separators ("1,234.56") â†’ parse correctly.
- Extra colons â†’ split only on the first colon for label/value.
- Negative or zero max â†’ handle gracefully (no division by zero).
- Very small values â†’ still visible via MIN_VISIBLE_PERCENT but donâ€™t change relative ordering.
- Avoid DOM position assumptions: always query `.bar-chart` within the slide content.

Now generate the full HTML document for the given input. Output only the raw HTML.
