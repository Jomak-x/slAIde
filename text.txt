GitHub Copilot

Good news: all three A2A services are now running and exchanging AgentCards.

What I fixed and ran

Presentation service

Filled pipeline and server main.
Set AgentCard default_input_modes/default_output_modes.
Started successfully on 8001.
Summary service

Fixed ADK Agent name to a valid identifier.
Set AgentCard default_input_modes/default_output_modes.
Started successfully on 8002.
Host service

Fixed imports, executor logic, and AgentCard fields.
Implemented remote card fetch and message routing.
Started successfully on 8000 and discovered both sub-agents:
Presentation Agent card resolved from http://localhost:8001
Summary Agent card resolved from http://localhost:8002
How to run locally (exact commands)

Terminal 1 (Presentation):
cd /Users/jakob/codestuff/knighthacksVII/slidAid/slAIde/presentation_agent
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv run --active .
Terminal 2 (Summary):
cd /Users/jakob/codestuff/knighthacksVII/slidAid/slAIde/summaryagent
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv run --active .
Terminal 3 (Host):
cd /Users/jakob/codestuff/knighthacksVII/slidAid/slAIde
python -m hostagent
Alternatively, from hostagent folder: source .venv/bin/activate && python -m hostagent
Notes

The uv shell command wasn’t found in one host terminal; I used python -m hostagent from the parent package to satisfy relative imports.
The ADK “app name mismatch” is a harmless warning from ADK. It doesn’t block A2A.
Testing the host

POST to http://localhost:8000/ with message/send to route based on keywords:
Include “summarize” to route to Summary Agent
Otherwise it routes to Presentation Agent
Do you also want me to remove extra .env files (keep only one at slAIde/.env) and simplify env usage? I can clean them now.



I’m GitHub Copilot. Here’s the concise status you asked for.

What works (when configured correctly)

A2A servers exist for Host, Presentation, Summary with AgentCards using snake_case default_input_modes/default_output_modes and streaming capability.
Presentation: ADK SequentialAgent (plan → write → render) returns full HTML as artifact text.
Summary: summarize tool (URL or content) with LaTeX stripping returns plain text.
Host: discovers sub-agent AgentCards via .well-known/agent-card.json, routes by keyword (“summary/summarize” → Summary; otherwise Presentation), forwards messages, aggregates artifacts.
What’s broken/blocking right now

Running sub-agents via “uv run --active .” causes “attempted relative import with no known parent package.” Fix: run with python -m presentation_agent and python -m summaryagent, or change __main__.py to absolute imports to support script execution.
Missing GOOGLE_API_KEY (or Vertex config) in slAIde/.env → sub-agents produce empty/failed outputs.
Ports 8001/8002/8000 may be in use → servers fail to start.
Host started before sub-agents → discovery fails; restart Host after both are up.
You reverted some env/import changes, so shared .env loading and run paths may be inconsistent again.
How far we are

Core multi-agent A2A flow is implemented end-to-end. Remaining work is run configuration/env and ensuring discovery/ports are clean. No major code gaps.
Minimal recovery plan

Use a single slAIde/.env with GOOGLE_API_KEY (or set GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE and Vertex creds).
Start Presentation (8001) and Summary (8002) with python -m from their package dirs; verify /well-known/agent-card.json for each.
Start Host (8000) after both are healthy; verify discovery logs; send a test message; expect HTML in result.artifacts[0].parts[0].text.
Switching model

Change model strings “gemini-2.5-flash” in:
adk_pipeline.py (all three LlmAgents)
summaryagent (build_summary_agent)
hostagent (Host_Agent)
Ensure credentials match your target provider (API key vs Vertex). Leave AgentCard modes/capabilities unchanged.
If pip/uv “don’t work”

Don’t mix pip and uv. Prefer one:
uv: run from each package directory with its pyproject/uv.lock.
pip: create a venv per agent and pip install -r requirements.txt.
If imports still fail with uv, use python -m which treats packages correctly.
Want me to re-apply the shared .env loading and adjust imports so uv run works again, or keep the python -m approach?
